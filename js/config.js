 *  THE FORGOTTEN QUEEN — Personalization
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  This is the ONLY file you need to edit to make the experience personal.
 *  Everything below is written to be replaced with your own words, memories,
 *  and truths about her. Keep the poetry, or make it entirely yours.
 *
 *  Tips:
 *   - Her name appears softly throughout. Set it in QUEEN.name.
 *   - To use real music, drop an .mp3 into assets/music/ and set QUEEN.music.
 *   - To end with your video, put it in assets/video/ and set QUEEN.finaleVideo.
 *     (If left empty, a gentle animated closing message is shown instead.)

  //  its photo as a living backdrop, with fog, god-rays, foliage and fireflies
  //  layered on top for depth and motion. Leave "" to use the drawn scenery.
  //  Recommended: lush landscape images ~1920px wide (jpg/png/webp).
