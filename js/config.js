 *  THE FORGOTTEN QUEEN — Personalization
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  This is the ONLY file you need to edit to make the experience personal.
 *  Everything below is written to be replaced with your own words, memories,
 *  and truths about her. Keep the poetry, or make it entirely yours.
 *
 *  Tips:
 *   - Her name appears softly throughout. Set it in QUEEN.name.
 *   - To use real music, drop an .mp3 into assets/music/ and set QUEEN.music.
 *   - To end with your video, put it in assets/video/ and set QUEEN.finaleVideo.
 *     (If left empty, a gentle animated closing message is shown instead.)

      "You are gentle with the whole world, and gentler still with the people lucky enough to be near you.",
      "There is a whimsy in you that turns ordinary days into small adventures. You make life more magical simply by being playful in it.",
      "You are beautiful — but it is the way you light up when you're happy that no one ever quite forgets.",
      "You are clever in a way that catches people off guard — quick, bright, and quietly wise.",

        title: "Every Road Leads to Meadows",
        tale: "Whenever you and your friend walk side by side, the road keeps a gentle habit: wherever it begins, it always seems to end in meadows of happiness.",

      {
        title: "The Simplest Magic",
        tale: "And the truest of all: to the friend who walks beside you, simply having you in their life makes every ordinary day warmer, lighter, and better. That, the realm knows, is the deepest magic there is.",

        cover: "For the Hard Days",
        text: "On the days you feel small or unsure — remember that whole forests have grown from someone as quiet and stubborn and luminous as you. You are not behind. You are becoming.",

      {
        cover: "A Wish, Unsigned",
        text: "I hope you are, one day, loved exactly as attentively as you love others. I hope you catch yourself in a mirror and, for once, see what everyone else already sees.",
      },
      {
        cover: "The One True Thing",
        text: "The world is more beautiful because you are in it. That is not a birthday nicety. It is the plainest fact this whole realm was built to tell you.",
      },
    ],
  },

  // ---- 4. The Blooming Meadow — flowers open because she approaches -------
  meadow: {
    intro: "Walk slowly. The flowers here have been closed for a long time. They only ever needed you to come near.",

      { name: "Radiance",   word: "There is a light to you, inside and out. People remember how you made them feel as much as how you looked doing it." },
      { name: "Brilliance", word: "Your mind is quick and bright. You understand things — and people — far faster than you ever let on." },

      "You have spent so long making yourself small enough to fit into other people's comfort.",
      "But this realm did not wake for someone small.",
      "It woke for a queen.",
      "Not the kind who rules — the kind who tends. Who mends. Who makes the world gentler by being in it.",
      "That crown was always yours. You simply set it down somewhere and forgot.",
